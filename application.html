    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Dinosaur Game is a running game where a dinosuar runs across the screen and you must dodge different obstacles to continue. The further you go, the more unlockable dinosaurs you'll be able to play as.</p>
    <h2>How To Play</h2>
    <p>To dodge the obstacles you click the up arrow to jump and the down arrow to duck. You must jump over the obstacles to avoid them, but also some obstacles you must duck under because you can't jump over them. The game is never-ending, so continue to duck and jump until you lose.</p>
